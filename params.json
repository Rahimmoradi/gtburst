{"name":"Gtburst","tagline":"GUI for analysis of GRBs and SFs with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope","body":"# gtburst\r\n\r\ngtBurst is a python GUI (Graphical User Interface) which can be used to analyze\r\nGamma-ray Bursts and Solar Flares observed by the instruments onboard the NASA\r\nFermi satellite (formerly known as GLAST).\r\n\r\n# No need to download it separately\r\n\r\ngtburst is now part of the official Fermi Science Tools package (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/). Just download and install the ST and you will be able to run gtburst by issuing \"gtburst\" on the command line.\r\n\r\n# Update to the latest version\r\n\r\nThe version of gtburst contained in the ST is most probably not the last one. While the ST have a release cycle of months, updates and new features for gtburst are issued much more frequently. \r\n\r\nOnce you are in the main GUI, select \"update to the latest version\" from the \"Update\" menu, and gtburst will download and install the updates. Then you will have to reset your session, and you are done.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
